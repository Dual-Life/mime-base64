This package contains a Base64 encoder/decoder implemented as an XS
function.  The module is compatible with the module distributed
together with libwww-perl.

The Base64 encoding is specified in RFC 2045 - I<MIME (Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extensions)>. The Base64 encoding is designed to
represent arbitrary sequences of octets in a form that need not be
humanly readable. A 65-character subset ([A-Za-z0-9+/=]) of US-ASCII
is used, enabling 6 bits to be represented per printable character.

Installation:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
